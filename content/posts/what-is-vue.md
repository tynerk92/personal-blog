## What Is Vue?

[](https://vuejs.org/)Vue is a [Reactive JavaScript Framework](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/reactive-programming-in-javascript-8373201a6618) created by [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) that is built to be versatile, performant, and easily approachable. After trying [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/), I have to say, Vue does the best job at this.

## Why Should I Use Vue?

JavaScript is just that, a scripting language. It was not designed to be a framework for designing applications. 

But, as developers do, we changed that. While Angular is used as a full framework, providing components, services and model storage, Vue focuses only on the "V" from the MVC (Model-View Controller) architecture. This means that Vue is highly specialized to give developers the best experience when creating re-usable HTML components.

Because of this, Vue is very easy to use with other frameworks that can cover the other parts of the MVC architecture. Due to its focused nature, it is really easy to scale Vue apps by keeping business logic separate from view logic.
